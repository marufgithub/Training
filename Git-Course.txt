Date : 1/19/2014

	1. Go to folder level
	2. type :  git init
	3. type :  git add -A   
(if we want to add all files in that folder, here A stands for All. 
Note : If nothing shown after type and enter that means evrything ok)
	4. type :  git commit -m "adding files"
	5. type :  git remote add origin git@github.com:bittechusa/Course-Outline.git
(here bittechusa will vary and will be company name and course-outline will also vary and will be folder/repository/repo name)
	6. type :  git push -u origin master
