What is Performance Testing?

Performance Testing is performed to determine response time of the some 
components of the system perform under a particular workload. 
It is generally measured in terms of response time for the user activity. 
It is designed to test the overall performance of the system at high load 
and stress condition It identifies the drawback of the architectural design 
which helps to tune the application. It includes the following:

Increasing number of users interacting with the system.
Determine the Response time.
Repeating the load consistently.
Monitoring the system components under controlled load.
Providing robust analysis and reporting engines.
